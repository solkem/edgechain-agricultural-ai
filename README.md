# 🌱 EdgeChain: Community-Owned Agricultural Intelligence

## 🚜 Why EdgeChain?

EdgeChain empowers **farmers as co-creators of technology**.  
By blending **edge AI, federated learning, privacy-preserving data sharing, and blockchain incentives**, we transform raw farm data into **collective intelligence** while keeping farmers in control of their privacy and rewards.

- 🌱 **Farmers First** → Ownership of data, models, and economic rewards  
- 🔒 **Privacy by Design** → No raw data leaves the farm  
- 🤝 **Collaborative Intelligence** → Federated learning builds stronger predictions for all  
- 💰 **Fair Rewards** → Transparent incentives via smart contracts  
- 🗳️ **Democratic Governance** → DAO-based voting and treasury management
